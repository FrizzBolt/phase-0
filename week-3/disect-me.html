<h2>Why should I care about version control?</h2>

<p>Good question! If you could just as easily update your code in OSX or Windows, you could save yourself the hassle of working in the command line and then everything would go faster and you wouldn't need to learn anything right? Well, yeah except that every time you want to save a new version of your work and keep the old one, you'd have to copy everything back into a new folder and copy everything over which takes up precious time and local hard drive space. All you really have to do to save over your ENTIRE project in git is just stage it and commit it which takes like 5 seconds. And what if you want to collaborate? It would be a huge hassle if everyone was just jumping onto one FTP site and updating one version of code. Everyone would be saving over and deleting everyone else's work and it would be a pain to track down who did what. That's why version control makes things easier for developers.</p>
