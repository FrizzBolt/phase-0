#1.6 Your Website Reflection


### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

1. First, you will need to register an account on GitHub if you haven't done so already. This part should be easy to figure out.
2. Next, check out the navigation bar in the top right hand side of the screen. See that plus sign with the little arrow next to it? Click on that and you'll see a dropdown menu with 2 options, "New repository" and "New organization". Click the one that says "New Repository".
3. Now you are ready to set the parameters of your repository. Go ahead and give it a name in the "Repository Name" box and add a description in the box underneath if you want. Underneath that, you can select whether you want to make your repository public or private. You'll have to upgrade your account if you want to make it private so just a heads up. I'm cheap so I tend to make my repositories public. Underneath that you're going to want to check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README". This will make it so you can clone your repository to your computer right away. Underneath that, click the option that says "Add a license:". Since we love free stuff and other people and want other people to have free stuff, we're going to add the MIT license to our repository.
4. Next, open up your terminal. If you don't know what a terminal is at this point, then you'll have to look that up first and come back to this tutorial at a later time. Make a directory within your terminal that you'll want the repository to jump onto your computer and navigate to that directory. Make sure you have git installed on your terminal.
5. Now you can go back on GitHub. We're going to get a link which will help us clone the repository to our computer. Go into your profile page and check out the repositories listed on your account. See the repository you just created? Click it!
6. Great! Now check out the right hand side of the GitHub window. See that little box with the writing that says "HTTPS clone URL" on it? Copy the contents of that box and head back into your terminal.
7. Now you're ready to clone your repository to your local system. In the terminal window, type "git clone " and then copy the text from that box on GitHub right afterwards on the same line. Hit enter.
8. Viola! You've created a GitHub repository and cloned it to your computer. Pat yourself on that back!


### Describe what open source means.

Open source gives engineers, developers, and scientists freedom to leave distribution of their products open as they so choose. This is achieved by allowing the project creators access to several forms of licenses with which they can distribute their product. The upside of open-source is that the source codes of software are free for educational and distribution purposes so anyone with an internet connection can access them.


### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I personally love the idea of open source communities and projects. I think it geniunely helps protect the interest of the public if intellectual property can be made available to the public and it encourages collaborative development of ideas. The ease in which open source developers can license their projects is also a welcome benefit.


### Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses can provide legal protection to the owners and users of intellectual property. This can be used as a means of protecting one's work from theft or being able to distribute one's work freely.


### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I think the most important thing I learned about in this challenge was the meaning of some of the various licenses in the open source community. Typically, I would use a piece of open source software and not know what the hell the licensing said I can do with it. This is good to know now that I'll be modifying that software! It may have save me from a lawsuit down the line.


### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Here are some resources I checked out that were fairly easy to understand:
