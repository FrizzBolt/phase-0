<!--

What concepts did you solidify in working on this challenge? (reviewing the passing of information, objects, constructors, etc.)

I got a lot of DOM practice here. I spent several hours on this assignment re-writing it and trying to get it to
work. In the process, I've learned quite a bit about DOM, but there's still a long way to go with it.


What was the most difficult part of this challenge?

Actually getting the damn thing to run. :P This is my third try at getting something like this to work and I 
always run into some ridiculous limitation of Javascript. It's been great practice, but at the same time very frustrating since it never seems to work despite the code looking nice.


Did an array or object make more sense to use and why?

I did this in the broser, so it was all adding different input forms and buttons.
