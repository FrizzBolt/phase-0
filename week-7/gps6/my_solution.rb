# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
#
#
#require_relative 'state_data'

#require_relative - finds a ruby file within the same folder as the spec file. It differs from require in that, require relative looks for a relative path and require looks for a direct link.

# Reflection Section

What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?

One set uses the rocket (=>) notation. The other set uses the symbol notation which stores the symbols
into memory. In this example, the symbol arrays are nested in the rocket arrays.


What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?

Require_relative references from a document using a relative path name. Require takes in a direct link.
Both of these take variables and data from another file.


What are some ways to iterate through a hash?

You can use your iterator with two different arguments. For instance, if you are using the #each iterator,
you can use the syntax like so:

hash.each do |key, value|

And iterate through your key or value by doing that. You can also use #each_key or #each_value.


When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?

The concept I think we solidified the most was the importance of making readable code vs making short code.
Neil was pretty adament about stressing this since we reduced our code down a bunch of lines, but also made
it really hard to read in the process. I'm glad he brought that up. The whole time we were going through,
I was unsure about our approach.
