- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

Since I used to make HTML sites a long time ago, there was nothing really new about what I was doing save for the DIV class. It was pretty easy working through the code and my partner and I split the workload pretty well. In the end, I'm happy with way the code looks.


- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I wished we would have used more semantic HTML5 elements in the making of this site. I went back afterwards and added a few tags for good measure. Hopefully those will come in handy when we have to add styling.


- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

We tried creating tables and then creating two unordered lists for the links section. We decided it was easiest to do the unordered list before styling. Both of the options looked pretty similar. All in all the code looks clean and we worked quickly. The site looks pretty similar to the example in the challenge briefing.


- What seems good and bad about HTML?

The upside of HTML is that it's super-easy. A person can learn solid HTML skills in a short amount of time and for that it's a very well designed language.

There can be some tedium in working with HTML. Good code requires constant repetition of tags when working with lists. Keeping code minimal is not easy and formatting while working can be tough.


- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I use flashcards for remembering tags. I have a program called Anki that uses a special algorithm to help display flash cards in a spaced out manner so they're easier to remember. W3Schools is also a great reference.
