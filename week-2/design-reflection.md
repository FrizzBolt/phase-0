###What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

#####1. Information Gathering

The first phase of design involves asking yourself relevant information related to your final product. In this, you should commonly consider the purpose of your site; the goals that you hope to accomplish with the site; the target audience of your site; and the information that your target audience will be accessing your site to retrieve.

#####2. Planning

Now that you have preliminary information, the next step is to start plotting out your website on a site map. A site map is a basic guide to the layout of your site which contains a hierarchy of links between the pages that will appear in the final design. This is set up in a sort of "mind map" style chart that will work as a means of guiding you through the prototyping process.

Additionally, functionality must be considered when planning your site. Your final website will serve one or more functions and the future relationship between those functions and your customer is something that should be taken into account in your site map design.

#####3. Design

Now for the design part! In this phase, you will create a wireframe or prototype design for your site. This prototype contains only very basic functionality if any, but lays out a guide of functionality for when future development takes place. The target audience must also be taken into consideration during the design phase as it involves playing to the audience's potential tastes in aesthetics. During this stage, the client and the designers share comments and concerns relating to the design and the upcoming development process until a final design is agreed upon.

#####4. Development

The development phase is where your final design gets turned into a functional website. The designer will typically start by creating a hierarchical shell of webpages which is then developed internally. The content is then added to the site or a content management system is put into place. The designer will keep in contact with the clients throughout the development process so changes can be made as the development process is carried out.

#####5. Testing and Delivery

At this phase, the final product is almost ready for release. The designer will put finishing touches on the website and run compatibility checks to make sure that the code works on every browser.

The site is then uploaded to a server via an FTP (File Transfer Protocol) in compliance with a domain name host or web host. The site is then given a final compatibility and functionality check. Plugins may be installed to the site during the final check incuding search engine optimisation plugins which will make the site more visible and easy to locate in search engines.

The site is then launched and released to the public.

#####6. Maintenance

Now that the website is up and running, it will need to be updated periodically with new content time goes on. Browser standards will change and file formats will need to be updated accordingly. New content will need to be added to the site. If the client wishes to update the site without updating the code, they will do so through the previously installed content management system.

###What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site will essentially be a virtual resume which will include coding samples and links to any pages that I've worked on. It will, of course, include the material of my regular resume as well. The goal of this website will be to show potential employers that I am an able-minded and well-connected developer which will be an interesting challenge considering I have barely any prior experience.


###What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?	

My target audience will expect a brief, concise showcase of my talents as a developer. This will require an attractive, functional layout that is easy to navigate as. I believe that first impressions are very important so I would like to make a statement right when the page finishes loading.


###What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

First and foremost, I'd like them to be able to see my portfolio or an example of my work. I think this is probably what a potential employer would be most concerned about so I don't want them to have to spend time clicking around to find out what kind of work I've done. Since there will be other developers to choose from, I want to show that I'm capable right off the bat. Maybe if I can write a neat visual effect in Javascript on the main menu that would catch an employer's eye. 


###What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

Design and user experience are central components to creating a web site. Some of the ultimate goals of a web design and UX are create functional, easy to navigate, and aesthetically attractive products. Some smaller companies may not choose to hire UX designers, but more complex websites may require a person or team to plan the architecture of the site. 

###What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 

User experience design is the process of structurally laying out a site so that it is easy for the user to navigate and access its functionalities. This can be achieved through A/B product testing, user flow charts, or a number of other tools of the trade. This is important for commercial businesses since the customer or prospective customer that is accessing the site will need be able to navigate it with minimal to no prior knowledge as to the function of the site.


###Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Rewriting the 6 phases of web design was a little tedious, but it admittedly forced me to memorize the process. Other than that,this was a pretty fun challenge.
