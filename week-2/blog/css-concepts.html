	<h4>What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?</h4>

	Adding the side borders of the website took two tries. I wanted to have the main content centered in the page by two colored margin's and then have the body of the document cast a shadow on those margins.  My first design involved having two elements on either side of the body which framed it in the center, but after some careful thought, I reasoned that it would be a lot more browser friendly if I added a background color to the html document itself and then added a margin around the body of the document and then had the body itself cast the box shadow. I think this design is more responsive and works better in all browsers, but I'm definitely going to redesign the site at some point since the design is a little too simple for my taste.

	<h4>What did you learn about CSS positioning?</h4>

	I learned that CSS positioning is a lot harder than it sounds. Positioning elements was by far the most challenging part of this excercise. There are a lot of different ways to position elements and certain strategies only with different positioning styles. This can be quite an issue for relative beginners like me.

	<h4>What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?</h4>

	Surprisingly, positioning the row of buttons on the bottom of the site took a very long time. I didn't know enough about positioning when I started and did not expect it to be such a complex subject within CSS, so making a row of buttons that stays centered on the page was a huge endeavor and one that left me filling silly for obsessing over so much. There are a lot of different ways to center things within CSS, and even though there probably should be, there is no universal "center" attribute which makes centering objects finicky. I was also having an issue with what's commonly referred to as CSS jittering with my main banner. Every time I expanded the page past a certain point, the banner would jump from the center of the screen to the left. This took quite a lot of tinkering to fix.

	<h4>What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?</h4>

	ßßI learned that I have a tendency to add redundant tags in my code and, when I do that, it's a lot like leaving myself a sink full of dirty dishes.. Cleaning up as you go is an important lesson in code and in life. I also learned that the internet has a lot of conflicting opinions on how to handle some very simple formatting elements in CSS which makes me wonder about the integrity of the language.
